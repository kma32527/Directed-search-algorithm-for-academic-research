# Recommender System for Academic Literature
This is an experiment in using text mining on academic literature in a prospective manner. The eventual goal is to develop a tool for identifying novel interdisciplinary research connections. I extract keyword-like features from research documents to pick up on terminological trends. I opt for this approach because I believe that latent semantics is an accurate representation of research intuition.
